### ✦ About

Graphon is built on a simple philosophy: **Your data belongs to you.** We are building a productivity tool that merges the fluidity of writing with the structure of project management. Inspired by the speed of *Raycast* and the elegance of *Linear*, Graphon is designed to be the last workspace you'll ever need.

* **Local-First:** Zero latency, 100% offline capability.
* **Privacy-Centric:** End-to-end encryption with optional cloud sync.
* **Extensible:** A plugin architecture designed for developers.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

Our architecture prioritizes performance and modern developer experience.
